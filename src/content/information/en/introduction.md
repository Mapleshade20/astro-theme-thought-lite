**ThoughtLite** is a modern [Astro](https://astro.build/) theme focused on content creation.

The author previously used a self-built theme based on [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction), but due to difficulties in i18n handling, too many redundant features, and high maintenance costs, decided to migrate to Astro.

The theme focuses on core content-related functions, equipped with auxiliary modules like comments, aiming to build an **efficient and transparent** space for creation and communication.

The theme is developed and designed for the [**CloudFlare Workers**](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) environment, fully leveraging its advantages of **easy deployment**, **low cost**, and **high performance**. Additionally, the theme supports modern features such as **multilingual switching**, **responsive layout**, and **dynamic content filtering**, providing users with a smooth experience.

If you are interested in the theme, please visit the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/tuyuritio/astro-theme-thought-lite) for more information and quick start guide.
